# Database Connection Troubleshooting

This document explains how we fixed the SQLite database connection issues in the Annual Report Analyzer application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Function Name Mismatch**
   - The function was named `get_db()` in database_session.py but was being referenced as `get_db_session()` in some files
   - Fixed by updating all references to use the correct function name

2. **Database Path Inconsistency**
   - The .env file had a relative path that was causing issues: `sqlite:///backend/annual_reports.db`
   - Changed to use a simpler relative path: `sqlite:///./annual_reports.db`

3. **Path Resolution Improvements**
   - Updated database_session.py to use absolute paths for the database file
   - Added code to ensure the database directory exists before attempting to connect
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Implemented a fallback to in-memory database if the file-based connection fails

4. **SQLAlchemy Query Syntax**
   - Updated SQLAlchemy queries to use the proper text() wrapper for raw SQL statements
   - Example: `db.execute(text("SELECT 1"))` instead of `db.execute("SELECT 1")`

5. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logging with tracebacks
   - Added checks for file permissions and directory existence
   - Added database connection testing on startup

## Key Changes

1. **database_session.py**
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Implemented absolute path resolution
   - Added directory existence checks
   - Added file permission checks
   - Added connection testing
   - Added fallback to in-memory database

2. **pdf_processing_routes.py**
   - Fixed function name from `get_db_session()` to `get_db()`
   - Added robust error handling in background processing
   - Added null checks before closing database connections

3. **process_annual_report.py**
   - Fixed function name from `get_db_session()` to `get_db()`
   - Added path resolution for imports
   - Added comprehensive error handling

4. **test_db_connection.py**
   - Created a test script to verify database connections
   - Tests working directory permissions
   - Tests direct SQLite connections
   - Tests SQLAlchemy connections

## Best Practices for SQLite in Production

1. **Use Absolute Paths**
   - Always use absolute paths for SQLite database files to avoid path resolution issues
   - Example: `sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database.db`

2. **Check Directory Permissions**
   - Ensure the application has read/write permissions to the database file and directory
   - Test by creating a small file in the same directory

3. **Handle Connections Properly**
   - Always close database connections in finally blocks
   - Check if connections exist before trying to close them

4. **Use Proper Error Handling**
   - Catch and log specific database exceptions
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for critical operations

5. **Test Connections Early**
   - Test database connections at application startup
   - Fail fast if connections cannot be established

## Testing Database Connections

Run the test script to verify database connections:

```bash
python backend/test_db_connection.py
```

This script will:
1. Test if the current directory is writable
2. Test direct SQLite connections
3. Test SQLAlchemy connections
4. Report any issues with detailed error messages
