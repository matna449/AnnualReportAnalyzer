# HuggingFace Service Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Parameter Naming Errors
- Fixed incorrect parameter naming in API calls:
  - Changed `text=inputs` to just `inputs` for all API calls
  - Replaced the `parameters` dictionary with direct parameter passing for each method

### Service Availability Improvements
- Added specific handling for 503 Service Unavailable errors
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Enhanced fallback mechanisms when models are unavailable
- Added more detailed logging about which models are unavailable
- Implemented final fallback to mock responses when all retries fail

## Testing Improvements
- Restructured test file using unittest framework
- Added isolated tests for each API method
- Implemented tests for both success and failure paths
- Added mock server option for testing without relying on external services
- Added specific tests for error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed import statements for better compatibility
- Added more detailed logging throughout the service
- Improved error handling with more specific error types
- Enhanced documentation with better comments

## Usage
To run the tests with mock API (no external dependencies):
```bash
USE_MOCK_API=true python backend/test_huggingface_service.py
```

To run the tests with real API (requires valid API key):
```bash
USE_MOCK_API=false python backend/test_huggingface_service.py
```
